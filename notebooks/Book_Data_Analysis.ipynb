🟦 Markdown Cell 1 — Title & Overview
# 📚 Goodreads Books Data Analysis

In this notebook, we will analyze a dataset containing books from Goodreads (source: Jeffrey Allen on Kaggle).  
Our goal is to explore patterns and insights such as:

- How book ratings are distributed  
- Which authors appear most frequently  
- Whether there is a relationship between number of pages and average rating  
- What genres or characteristics might influence book popularity

## Dataset Description
The data was previously cleaned and processed in the ETL stage (`clean_data.py`).  
We will now load the cleaned file:

data/processed/books_clean.csv

🟦 Code Cell 1 — Import and Load Data
import pandas as pd

# Load the cleaned dataset
df = pd.read_csv("data/processed/books_clean.csv")

# Display dataset info
df.info()
df.head()

🟦 Markdown Cell 2 — Exploratory Data Analysis
## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Let's start by exploring the structure, key statistics, and patterns in the dataset.

🟦 Code Cell 2 — Descriptive Statistics
# Basic statistics
df.describe()

🟦 Markdown Cell 3 — Rating Distribution
### ⭐ Distribution of Average Ratings
Let's visualize how book ratings are distributed across the dataset.

🟦 Code Cell 3 — Plot Rating Distribution
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
plt.hist(df["average_rating"], bins=20, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.title("Distribution of Average Ratings")
plt.xlabel("Average Rating")
plt.ylabel("Number of Books")
plt.show()

🟦 Markdown Cell 4 — Top Authors
### 👑 Top 10 Most Frequent Authors
Which authors have published the most books in this dataset?

🟦 Code Cell 4 — Top Authors Visualization
top_authors = df["authors"].value_counts().head(10)

plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
top_authors.plot(kind="barh", color='lightcoral', edgecolor='black')
plt.title("Top 10 Authors by Number of Books")
plt.xlabel("Number of Books")
plt.ylabel("Author")
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()
plt.show()

🟦 Markdown Cell 5 — Pages vs Ratings
### 📘 Relationship Between Number of Pages and Ratings
We will check if longer books tend to receive higher or lower average ratings.

🟦 Code Cell 5 — Scatter Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
plt.scatter(df["  num_pages"], df["average_rating"], alpha=0.4, color='mediumseagreen')
plt.title("Number of Pages vs Average Rating")
plt.xlabel("Number of Pages")
plt.ylabel("Average Rating")
plt.show()

🟦 Markdown Cell 6 — Correlation
### 🔢 Correlation Check
Let's see the numeric correlation between `num_pages` and `average_rating`.

🟦 Code Cell 6 — Correlation
df[["  num_pages", "average_rating"]].corr()

🟦 Markdown Cell 7 — Conclusions
## 🧠 Conclusions

- Most books have ratings between **3.5 and 4.5**, suggesting readers tend to rate positively.  
- The most frequent authors are not necessarily those with the highest-rated books.  
- There is **no strong correlation** between the number of pages and average rating.  
- Potential next steps could include:
  - Sentiment analysis on book descriptions  
  - Genre-based comparisons  
  - Building a recommendation system based on ratings and authors
